In this project I attempt to learn the following things:
1. How a nested model can be updated as part of the single form
    - Use of accept_nested_attributes_for method for the associated child object of the parent object
2. As learning by serendipity, I got to understand that by missing a colon :, 
   for the symbol-key :allow_destroy => true option of accept_nested_attributes,
   the application doesn't throw any error and rather will only show one empty record in new form for a collection of child records.
   Refer my commit in this project for instance => https://github.com/karthiks/rails_3_1_sample_projects/commit/98af4876876345ccbbb5fa145fba2c0732751c0f
   I debugged and learnt it a very hard way :(
